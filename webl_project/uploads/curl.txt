## Using curl
Syntax: curl [options] [URL...]
eg. curl example.com

The command will print the source code of the example.com
homepage in your terminal window.

If no protocol is specified, curl tries to guess
the protocol you want to use, and it will default to HTTP.

## Save the output to a File
To save the result of the curl command, use either the -o or -O option.

Lowercase -o saves the file with a predefined filename,
which in the example below is vue-v2.6.10.js:

eg. curl -o vue-v2.6.10.js https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js

Uppercase -O saves the file with its original filename
e.g. curl -O https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js
